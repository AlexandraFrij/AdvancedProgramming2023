# AdvancedProgramming2023 - Homework 1

## Homework exercises

- [x] Let n be an integer given as a command line argument. Validate the argument!
- [x] Create a n x n Latin Square as a matrix, having as symbols numbers from 1 to n.
- [x] For each line, and each column of the matrix, create and display on the screen String objects representing the concatenation of the symbols in the respective line or column.
- [ ] For larger n display ONLY the running time of the application in nanoseconds or milliseconds. Try n > 30_000. You might want to adjust the JVM Heap Space using the VM options -Xms4G -Xmx4G.
- [ ] Launch the application from the command line, for example: java Lab1 9.



--------------
## Homework observations

- [ ] For the Latin Square, the dimension of the matrix is not n, but a random given dimension.



--------------
## Bonus exercises

- [ ] Create the adjacency matrix A of a cycle graph Cn and compute the powers A2, A3, .... An. Give an interpretation of the result.
- [x] Create the adjacency matrix of a regular graph. The number of vertices and the vertex degree are given as arguments.



--------------
## Bonus observations

- [ ] The method for the 2nd exercise does not handle the case in which both the vertecises number and the vertex degree are odd numbers (in which the is no k-regulat graph).
